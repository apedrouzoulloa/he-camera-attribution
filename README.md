## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the protocolos introduced in:

Alberto Pedrouzo-Ulloa, Fernando Pérez-González, David Vázquez-Padín. "Secure Collaborative Camera Attribution." EICC 2022: 97-98.

The code was used to generate the runtimes reported in:

Alberto Pedrouzo-Ulloa, Fernando Pérez-González, David Vázquez-Padín. "Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption for Collaborative Camera Attribution," 5th HomomorphicEncryption.org Standards Meeting, Geneva, Switzerland, 2022.

The repository includes:
1. Implementations of the protocols for aggregation and matching functionalities.
2. A PDF of the poster presented at HES'22.
